# OskageGit

## Description

This is my implementation of git in pure python based on this tutorial 
[1]. I think it help me to understand how git actually works. I have read
a book about git [2] and need some practice to reinforce understanding.

I follow the tutorial, but not completely. I'm making some changes like 
adding typehints, restructuring the project a bit to fit common coding 
practices.

## Run

```bash
./ogit [command]
```
